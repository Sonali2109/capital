What Fraud Scenarios Are Prevented

Changing ticket details (event ID, amount, user info) → fails verification.
Changing quantity or event date → fails verification.
Forging a signature without the private key → impossible (cryptographically infeasible).
Replay attack with modified payload → fails because modified payload ≠ signed message.

How it Works
You serialize the entire ticketPayload to JSON and sign that exact string.
The signature is generated using Ed25519 (deterministic digital signature) with your private key.

During verification:
The same ticketPayload JSON string is reconstructed.
The signature is checked using the public key.
If any field in ticketPayload changes (e.g., quantity, ticketId, totalAmount, etc.), the JSON string will change, and the signature will no longer match.
If someone tries to modify the signature, verification fails because the signature is tied to the original message + private key.

Edge Cases to Consider
Order of JSON keys: JSON.stringify() ensures a deterministic order only if you pass the same object with the same key order. If keys come in a different order, the string will differ → verification fails.
    Fix: Use a canonical JSON serializer or Object.keys(payload).sort() before stringify.
Whitespace differences: Since you’re using JSON.stringify(), there are no extra spaces → good.
Encoding differences: Ensure both client and server use UTF-8 consistently.

Added canonicalStringify():
Sorts keys alphabetically.
Handles nested objects and arrays properly.
Ensures consistent output for signing & verifying.
Used canonicalStringify() instead of JSON.stringify() in both signing and verification.

Why This Fixes the Problem:
If JSON keys come in a different order (like from DB vs API), JSON.stringify() could produce different strings, making the signature invalid. Now order won’t matter because keys are always sorted.

What You Did Well

Canonical JSON: You used a custom canonicalStringify() function that sorts keys and handles nested objects and arrays properly.
Timestamp-based Expiration:
issuedAt is added for auditing.
expiresAt is calculated from eventEndTime + 30 mins (good buffer for late arrivals).

Signature Verification:
You first check the signature.
Then check for ticket expiration.
You return a reason when invalid (great for debugging).
Asynchronous sodium usage is correct (await sodium.ready before crypto operations).
Return format for verify is good ({ valid: true/false, reason? }).
